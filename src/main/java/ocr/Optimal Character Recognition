Overview
    If you want to extract text from images using Java , this is the tutorial for you.
    We will use tesseract library , intellij and java runtime time to navigate this feature.

Tesseract

    Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine developed by HP that recognizes more than 100 languages,
    It contains two OCR engines for image processing â€“ a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) OCR engine
    and a legacy OCR engine that works by recognizing character patterns.

    The OCR engine uses the Leptonica library to open the images and supports various output formats.


 Set Up

    Tesseract is available for major OS.

    To install in mac , you can use brew
        brew install tesseract

    To install in Linux can use Yum
        yum install tesseract

Validation

       To validate installation correctness. You can try extracting text from image using following command
            tesseract *.png output

       Replace  * with actual image name and path


Java Application
    Tess4J is a Java wrapper for the Tesseract APIs that provides OCR support for
    various image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP.

    Add tess4j dependency in your maven project by adding following in pom.xml

        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.sourceforge.tess4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>tess4j</artifactId>
            <version>4.5.1</version>
        </dependency>


    Then create Java class with following code
        File image = new File("path to image");
        Tesseract tesseract = new Tesseract();
        tesseract.setDatapath("abosulte path /src/main/resources/tessdata ");
        tesseract.setLanguage("eng");
        tesseract.setPageSegMode(1);
        tesseract.setOcrEngineMode(1);
        String result = tesseract.doOCR(image);

    Download osd.traineddata and eng.traineddata files from  bhttps://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best/blob/main/osd.traineddata
     and https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast/blob/main/eng.traineddata respectively
     and place it /src/main/resources/tessdata. Make sure    tesseract.setDatapath is set to absolute path.


  Execute the Java main file , you can see the text generated from image file.


  Errors
    1. You might get following error
        java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Unable to load library 'tesseract': Native library (darwin/libtesseract.dylib)
    Problem : Tess4j is just a wrapper over tesseract. However maven library isn't actually refering to installed tesseract

    Solution : Point tess4j libraray to your OSS instaleld library

    Steps:
        1. Navigate to Tess4J maven install directiory :cd  absoultepath/.m2/repository/net/sourceforge/tess4j/tess4j/4.5.1
        2. mkdir darwin
        3. jar uf tess4j-4.5.1.jar darwin
        4. cp /usr/local/Cellar/tesseract/4.1.1/lib/libtesseract.4.dylib darwin/libtesseract.dylib
        5. jar uf tess4j-4.5.1.jar darwin/libtesseract.dylib
        6. jar tf tess4j-4.5.1.jar

    2. Not able to load eng.traineddata
            Solution : Provide absolute path for trainedata
